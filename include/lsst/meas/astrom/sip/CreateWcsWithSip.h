/**
 \brief Measure the distortions in an image plane and express them a SIP polynomials 

 Given a list of matching sources between a catalogue and an image,
 and a linear Wcs that describes the mapping from pixel space in the image
 and ra/dec space in the catalogue, calculate discrepancies between the two
 and compute SIP distortion polynomials to describe the discrepancy

 SIP polynomials are defined in Shupe at al. (2005) ASPC 347 491.

 Note that the SIP standard insists (although it is only mentioned obliquly
 between Eqns 3 and 4) that the lowest three terms in the distortion
 polynomials be zero (A00, A10, A01, B00, etc.). To achieve this, we need to 
 adjust the values of CD and CRPIX from the input wcs. This may not be the 
 behaviour you expect.

 A Wcs may be created in a variety of ways (e.g. lsst::meas::astrom::net::GlobalAstrometrySolution ), 
 and the list of matched sources (matches) can be generated with the matchRaDec function.

 \code
 #Example usage 
 matches = matchRaDec(catSet, srcSet, 1.0*afwGeom.arcseconds, true)
 wcs = getWcsFromSomewhere()

 maxScatter=0.1
 maxOrder= 10
 sipObject = CreateWcsWithSip(matches, wcs, maxScatter, maxOrder)
 wcs = sipObject.getNewWcs()
 \endcode

 Note that the matches must be one-to-one; this is ensured by passing closest=true to matchRaDec.
